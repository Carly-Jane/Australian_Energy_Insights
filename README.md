* State average income vs the % of energy productions that is renewable.
* State energy production per capita.
* State renewable energy production per capita.
* State non renewable energy production per capita.
* State budget on energy vs energy per capita (can be split into renewables and non renewables).
* State budget on renewables vs the % of energy being produced that is renewable.
